OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
This is a single page App:
This neighborhood map creates the town of  Castine, Maine and shows map markers for food,and interesting venues the markers show information when clicked. The app provides a sidebar that a user can make searches  by typing names of venues in the input text field button. One can search for Inn's or Bakery. The yellow search button filters venues by name or type of venue in the menu below. When a marker is selected the marker bounces to indicate and identify the venues location on the map. 

Additional software dependencies to create this App on the local server are the npx create react app, which created all the basic starter files in development mode. The create-react-app includes a service worker in the production build. Running npm build will builds the project for production. The react app by default is in dev mode. The service worker only works when npm build is ran and in production.


How to run... install node and npm,
npm install (this installs dependencies needed for package json) and npm start (this starts the local server). Opens broswer to localhost:3000.
